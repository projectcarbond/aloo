An easy starting point with ReactJS, SASS and Redux with Server Side Rendering.

## Why use aloo?

Does not come with a lot of pre-config, almost everything is seperately handled such that you can modify based your needs while using the popular dev standards:
- ES2017 Support for both Frontend and Backend
- ExpressJS static server (can also be configured to be an API server!)
- ReactJS + Redux (with server side rendering to [optimize load speed](https://hackernoon.com/server-side-vs-client-side-rendering-in-react-apps-443efd6f2e87)) 
- SASS for styling (with glob importing)
- Jest + Enzyme + Eslint for extensive testing
- Travis CI/CD Support (however easily portable to your choice of CI/CD)
